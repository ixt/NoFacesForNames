# No face for names  

A collection of scripts for various things I needed for the programming side of NoFaceForNames  
  
* Narrative/Memento downloading script for linux (as well as rotation)  
* openFrameworks app that takes arguments and cuts out faces from photos (resizing them to 384x384 in b&w)  
* mplayer speed control for heartbeat  

everything is provided as is, CC-0 (see COPYING.TXT) for all my work, there is an included haar cascade it is not mine, i can remove it upon request   

it will probably be still sloppy in places but hopefully it may help you with whatever you want  
note: that in some places paths are from the home directory, always study the code before running
